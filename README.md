## My Journey: From Curiosity to Passion

<div align="center">

| Year | The Story |
|------|-----------|
| **2019** | **The Spark** - WeThinkCode visited my school in Grade 12. When they mentioned a starting salary of R20k for developers, I was immediately hooked. This was my introduction to the world of software development. |
| **2020** | **Gap Year & Discovery** - No university accepted me, so I took a gap year. During this time, I watched *The Social Network* and became fascinated with how Facebook was created. The intrigue was real, and tech became my obsession. |
| **2021** | **The Beginning** - Applied to TUT for Computer Science. I didn't even know how to use a PC properly. Everything was confusing. But then I typed my first "Hello World" and got so excited - I genuinely thought I did something amazing! |
| **2022** | **The Struggle** - I thought once I learned to use a PC, things would be easy. I was wrong. This year was incredibly hard. The learning curve was steep, and I questioned myself often. |
| **2023** | **The Turnaround** - Things started clicking. I began improving academically, understanding concepts better, and my confidence grew. The pieces were finally coming together. |
| **2024** | **The Fire Ignites** - This was the year everything changed. I genuinely started ENJOYING coding. The passion ignited, and suddenly it wasn't just about passing - it was about creating, building, and solving problems. |
| **2025-2026** | **Present Day** - The passion continues to grow stronger. Now with 16 months of development experience and 3 months of UI/UX design experience in Figma, I'm actively seeking to join an innovative tech company where I can make an impact. |
